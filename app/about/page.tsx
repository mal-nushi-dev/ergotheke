      <h1 className="mb-8 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tighter">About Me</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I am a dedicated software engineer specializing in data engineering and 
        data systems at Ally Financial. In this role, I play a crucial part in 
        supporting our business data needs, developing robust data solutions 
        that drive strategic decisions and enhance operational efficiencies. 
        My professional journey in data systems began after my academic studies 
        at Wayne State University, where I honed my skills and fueled my passion 
        for technology.
        <br />

        Beyond my specialization, I have a keen interest in a variety of 
        technology domains. I am constantly engaged in writing, designing, 
        and building new projects, driven by a desire to explore and innovate. 
        My passion for tech is complemented by creative problem-solving, and I 
        am always eager to expand my horizons and engage with new ideas in the 
        tech world.

        My personal story is marked by a significant chapter when I became a 
        refugee from Kosovo, moving to Michigan in 1999 to escape the war. 
        This experience has profoundly shaped my perspective and resilience. 
        Since then, I was raised in Metro Detroit, a community that has played 
        a pivotal role in both my personal and professional life.
        <br />

        Outside of work, my interests are diverse and reflect my curiosity 
        about the world. I have a passion for photography, capturing moments 
        and landscapes that tell stories. Other aveneus where I find joy and 
        relaxation are: surf-skating, building legos, music, and soccer. I also 
        cherish traveling, as it offers me opportunities to explore new cultures 
        and environments, further broadening my worldview.

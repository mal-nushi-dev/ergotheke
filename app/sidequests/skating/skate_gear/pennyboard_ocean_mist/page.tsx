      <p className="mb-4">
        I honestly bought this board because a deal I saw on an Instagram ad was
        too good to pass up on. This is the shortest board on my list by a long
        shot and also the most narrow. The fact that there is no grip tape on it
        makes it so difficult to ride. Some good things I would say about the
        boards stock configuration is that trucks are responsive and while the
        wheels are small, they are also soft enough to handle rough ground. I
        have no issues so far with the bearings or pivot cups, though I have not
        really ridden this board that much to wear anything out.

        I thought of using AI for this, because honestly I think it is difficult
        describing yourself. I can't be the only one who thinks this, right? So

        <br></br>I am a Charlotte, NC based Software Engineer @ Ally Financial.
        I specialize in the data-side of things working closely with our data

        Without getting into too much detail about my personal life: because of
        the war in Kosovo ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡±, my parents brought our family to the U.S. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ as
        immigrants and refugees, for which I'm endlessly grateful. Both my
        parents are a huge inspirations of how much a person can achieve even
        during hardships.

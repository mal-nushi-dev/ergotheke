# malnushi.com | Personal Website & Portfolio

This is my source code for my personal website: malnushi.com. This site showcases
my work, projects, interests, and blog. I developed this website using TypeScript,
Next.js, and other modern web tools.

## Features

- **Portfolio & Blog**: While this site does come with MDX and Markdown support, my blog posts are hyperlinks to an external log hosted on Substack. I get the feed using RSS. In my portfolio though, I do have dynamic OG, Tailwind v4, and Vercel Speed Insights / Web Analytics.
- **SEO Optimized**: Sitemap, robots.txt, JSON-LD schema
- **Sidequests**: Dedicated sections for passions like photography, music, pickleball, and skating, each with their own highlights.
- **Lab**: A curated list of my open-source projects.
- **About**: Personal background, inspirations, etc.

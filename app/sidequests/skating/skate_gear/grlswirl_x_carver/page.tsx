        The Original GRLSWIRL x Carver Surfskate

      <p className="mb-4">
        This board was a gift, and I absolutely love it. I ride it every week
        when I skate with Let's Skate Charlotte and friends. The deck is short,
        which makes it super maneuverable in the city; especially in NYC during
        the Big Apple Roll. Since it's designed for pumping and carving, I've
        set it up to lean into that style. With the Carver CX truck system, it
        feels looser and more flowy than a traditional skateboard, letting me
        pump for speed instead of pushing. The 70mm, 78a Surfskate Love wheels
        (sadly no longer for sale) are perfect — smooth over rough ground, tons
        of grip, and still quick to accelerate. The Riptide bushings give more
        rebound than the stock Carver ones, which I really like. I can't say I
        notice much difference with the Riptide pivot cups, but it was worth
        swapping them in since my old ones were worn out. And the G|Bomb
        bearings? Just a solid, affordable choice that's held up without a
        single issue.
